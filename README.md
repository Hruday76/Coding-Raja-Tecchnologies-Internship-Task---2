The task involves developing an image classification model capable of recognizing different types of food items from images. This could be useful in various applications such as dietary monitoring, food recognition in social media posts, or restaurant menu analysis.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing images of various food items, properly categorized into different classes. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the image classification model.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the collected data for training by performing tasks like resizing images to a uniform size, normalizing pixel values to a common scale, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

Model Architecture: Select an appropriate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for the task. Popular choices include VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet, which have been proven effective in image classification tasks.

Transfer Learning: Utilize a pre-trained CNN model as a base and fine-tune it for the specific food classification task. Transfer learning enables leveraging the knowledge learned from a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) to improve the model's performance on the target task with a smaller dataset.

Model Training: Train the adapted CNN model on the preprocessed dataset. During training, the model learns to differentiate between different food categories by adjusting its parameters based on the provided training examples.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using the testing dataset. Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to gauge how well the model generalizes to unseen food images.

Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions on sample images and explore misclassified images to gain insights into areas where the model may be struggling. Visualization aids in understanding the model's behavior and identifying potential areas for improvement.

Tech Stack:
Python: Programming language used for implementing the image classification model and associated tasks.
Deep Learning frameworks: Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch provide tools for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.
Image processing libraries: Libraries such as OpenCV or PIL are utilized for image preprocessing tasks like resizing and normalization, as well as for visualization purposes.
